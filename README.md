# Chess Monorepo

Welcome to my **Chess Monorepo**! This project is an online chess game where you can challenge a friend by sharing a game link. I built this with a modern tech stack that‚Äôs both fun to work with and effective for delivering a smooth chess experience. Let‚Äôs dive in! üèÜ

## Project Overview

This is a web-based chess game that allows two players to compete by sharing a game link. The backend is built using **Gleam** and **Wisp, while the frontend is powered by **Gleam**, **Lustre**, and **Vite**. It handles all the necessary logic and interactions, creating a dynamic and enjoyable chess experience.

## Tech Stack

### Server
- **Language:** [Gleam](https://gleam.run)
- **Framework:** [Wisp](https://github.com/gleam-wisp/wisp)
- **HTTP Webserver:** [Mist](https://github.com/rawhat/mist)

### Client
- **Language:** [Gleam](https://gleam.run)
- **Frontend Framework:** [Lustre](https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre)
- **Build Tool:** [Vite](https://vite.dev)

## Monorepo Structure

Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôve organized the project:

```
server/ - Backend server code (Gleam + Wisp)
client/ - Frontend client code (Gleam + Lustre + Vite)
shared/ - Shared modules between client and server
```


## Running the Application

### Server

The server handles all the chess game logic, including game creation and state management. It‚Äôs built using Gleam, with Wisp handling the framework and Mist serving as the HTTP webserver.

### Client

The client renders the chessboard and allows users to interact with the game. It‚Äôs built using Gleam with Lustre for the frontend and Vite for bundling.
