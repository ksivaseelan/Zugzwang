## Project Overview

This is a web-based chess game that allows two players to compete by sharing a game link. The backend is built using **Gleam** and **Wisp, while the frontend is powered by **Gleam**, **Lustre**, and **Vite**. It handles all the necessary logic and interactions, creating a dynamic and enjoyable chess experience.

## Tech Stack

### Server
- **Language:** [Gleam](https://gleam.run)
- **Framework:** [Wisp](https://github.com/gleam-wisp/wisp)
- **HTTP Webserver:** [Mist](https://github.com/rawhat/mist)

### Client
- **Language:** [Gleam](https://gleam.run)
- **Frontend Framework:** [Lustre](https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre)
- **Build Tool:** [Vite](https://vite.dev)

## Monorepo Structure

Here’s how I’ve organized the project:

```
server/ - Backend server code (Gleam + Wisp)
client/ - Frontend client code (Gleam + Lustre + Vite)
shared/ - Shared modules between client and server
```


## Running the Application

### Server

The server handles all the chess game logic, including game creation and state management. It’s built using Gleam, with Wisp handling the framework and Mist serving as the HTTP webserver.

### Client

The client renders the chessboard and allows users to interact with the game. It’s built using Gleam with Lustre for the frontend and Vite for bundling.
