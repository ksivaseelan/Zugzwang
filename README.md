## Getting Started  

### Running the Server  

The server is the brain of the operation, handling all the chess logic like game creation and keeping track of moves.  

```bash  
gleam run
```
### Running the Client
The client is where the magic happens: it renders the chessboard, animations, and handles player interactions.
```bash
bun dev  
```
Now open your browser, share a game link with a friend, and let the chess duels begin! ü•≥
